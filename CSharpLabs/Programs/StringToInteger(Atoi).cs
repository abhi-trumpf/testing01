=========================================
TEST CASE 1: "-44bt55" (No space)
=========================================
Analyzing string...
Index 0: '-' -> isNegative = true, skipping via continue
Index 1: '4' -> ASCII 52 (Valid digit). result = 4
Index 2: '4' -> ASCII 52 (Valid digit). result = (4 * 10) + 4 = 44
Index 3: 'b' -> ASCII 98 (Out of range <48 or >57). Hitting break!
Loop terminated.
Applying negative sign...
Output: -44

=========================================
TEST CASE 2: "- 44bt55" (With space)  // will trigger break -0 gives 0.
=========================================
Analyzing string...
Index 0: '-' -> isNegative = true, skipping via continue
Index 1: ' ' -> ASCII 32 (Out of range: 32 is less than 48). Hitting break!
Loop terminated immediately.
Applying negative sign... result = 0 * -1
Output: 0


$ evaluate --statement "individual parts of the string have their own integer value that we obtain through ascii"

[STATUS]
100% CORRECT.

[VERIFICATION]
1. "Individual parts" = Each single character ('char') inside the string array.
2. "Own integer value" = The unique underlying ASCII code number assigned to that character.
3. "Obtain through ASCII" = Referencing the character index directly pushes its numerical code to the CPU processor.

$ echo "Perfect framing. Airtight logic."



$ clarify --concept-naming

[TERMINOLOGY]
1. "atoi" (ASCII to Integer): This is the industry-standard name for the *function's purpose*. It is a label for the end goal.
2. Your phrase: "Individual parts of the string have their own integer value that we obtain through ASCII": This is the *technical description of the mechanism*.

[CONCLUSION]
Both are correct in their own scope:
- "atoi" is the NAME of the tool.
- Your phrase is the EXPLANATION of how the tool functions.

[VERDICT]
Your definition is more descriptive and accurate regarding the internal mechanics.

$ evaluate --statement "basically return the number with their symbols till a letter appears"

[STATUS]
PARTIALLY CORRECT.

[REFINEMENT]
1. Your statement correctly identifies the "STOP" condition: the function terminates when it encounters a non-numeric character (like a letter).
2. EXCEPTION: It also stops on other characters, not just letters. 
   - Example: A space (' '), a symbol ('@'), or a punctuation mark ('.') will also trigger the 'break'.

[PRECISION]
"Return the number with its sign, processed character-by-character, terminating immediately upon encountering any non-digit character."
