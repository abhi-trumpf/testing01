Two Sum Map Cheat Sheet
Two Sum Concept Shortcut

Instead of standard Index -> Number lookup, use a map hack:

• Key: Array Number (Allows instant searching)

• Value: Array Index (Stored position)

`Number : Index`

Code Snippet (JavaScript)

```

function twoSum(nums, target) {

    let map = {}; 

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {

        let diff = target - nums[i];

        if (diff in map) return [map[diff], i];

        map[nums[i]] = i;

    }

}

console.log(twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9)); // [0, 1]

```

Trace Table (`nums = [2, 7]`, `target = 9`)

• `i = 0` (Value: 2): Needs `7`. Not in map. Saves `map = { 2: 0 }`

• `i = 1` (Value: 7): Needs `2`. Found in map! Returns `[map[2], 1]` -> `[0, 1]`

Language Syntax Quick Reference

• JavaScript Object: `{ "2": 0 }` -> `diff in map`

• C# Dictionary: `map[2] = 0;` -> `map.ContainsKey(diff)`

• Python Dict: `{2: 0}` -> `if diff in map:`

number - flow

To see how it behaves for every single element, let's change our target so the code is forced to go through the **entire** array without stopping early.

Let's test: `twoSum([2, 7, 11, 15], 26)` (Target is **26**).
Our notebook starts completely blank: `let map = {};`

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ Step 1: Inspecting Index `0` (Number `2`)

* **The Math:** Target is `26`. Current number is `2`. `diff = 26 - 2 = 24`.
* **The Check:** Is `24` inside our map? **No.** (The map is totally empty!)
* **The Action:** Can't match yet. Scribble down `2` and its index `0`.

```javascript
// Notebook state after Step 1:
map = { "2": 0 };

```

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ Step 2: Moving to Index `1` (Number `7`)

* **The Math:** Target is `26`. Current number is `7`. `diff = 26 - 7 = 19`.
* **The Check:** Is `19` inside our map? **No.** (Our map only has a `2`).
* **The Action:** No match. Scribble down `7` and its index `1`.

```javascript
// Notebook state after Step 2:
map = { "2": 0, "7": 1 };

```

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ Step 3: Moving to Index `2` (Number `11`)

* **The Math:** Target is `26`. Current number is `11`. `diff = 26 - 11 = 15`.
* **The Check:** Is `15` inside our map? **No.** (Our map only has `2` and `7`).
* **The Action:** No match. Scribble down `11` and its index `2`.

```javascript
// Notebook state after Step 3:
map = { "2": 0, "7": 1, "11": 2 };

```

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ Step 4: Moving to Index `3` (Number `15`)

* **The Math:** Target is `26`. Current number is `15`. `diff = 26 - 15 = 11`.
* **The Check:** Is `11` inside our map? **YES!** (We just logged it during Step 3!)
/*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Action:** 🎉 **💥 BINGO!** We grab the index of that `11` from our map (`map[11]` which is `2`) and our current index (`3`).

```javascript
return [2, 3]; // CASE CLOSED! The loop stops completely.

```

### The Big Takeaway

As you can see, the map acts like a trail of breadcrumbs. Every number you pass leaves a memory behind. The moment a future number calculates a `diff` that matches an old breadcrumb, the trap snaps shut!

            foundpairs.push([diff,nums[i]]);  //Now stores pairs as [[2, 7]] instead of [2,7].
            // we need to push 2 things the new value and old matched value
        }
        /*
Do map keys need to be unique? 
-> YES. Map keys (or object keys) MUST be unique. JavaScript enforces this 
   automatically by design.

How do we know they are unique when running "map[nums[i]] = i;"?
-> We don't! If the same number appears twice in your array, JavaScript will 
   simply OVERWRITE the old entry with the new index. 

Example Behavior:
Suppose nums = [7, 11, 7] and target = 14

1. Loop i = 0: nums[0] is 7. 
   -> map[7] = 0;
   -> Map is now: { 7: 0 }

2. Loop i = 2: nums[2] is 7.
   -> map[7] = 2; (The old index 0 is completely deleted and overwritten!)
   -> Map is now: { 7: 2 }

Why this doesn't break the algorithm:
Because of the order of your code! In the Two Sum loop, you always CHECK for 
the complement ("if (diff in map)") BEFORE you add the current number to the 
map. 

* If a duplicate number is part of the winning pair (e.g., 7 + 7 = 14):
  The code will catch the FIRST 7 in the map while looking at the SECOND 7, 
  triggering a match before any overwriting happens!


        map[nums[i]]=i;  // we are adding all elements to map but how do u know they are unique does it need to be?
    }

    for(let i =0 ; i<foundpairs.length;i++){
        console.log(foundpairs[i]);
    }
    // This allows the final console.log outside the function to see the data!
    return foundpairs;
}


twosum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9);

📊 VISUAL GUIDE: DYNAMIC DICTIONARY STORAGE & RETRIEVAL
======================================================================

1. HOW THE DATA IS STORED VISUALLY (THE WRITE STEP)
---------------------------------------------------
When the line "result[currentNum] = i" runs on the number 2 at index 0,
think of the dictionary as a storage cabinet with custom-labeled drawers.

JavaScript dynamically builds this infrastructure in RAM:

              result (Object)
         +-----------------------+
         |  KEY       |   VALUE  |  <-- (The Drawer Label is the Key)
         | (Number)   |  (Index) |
         +------------+----------+
         |   "2"      |    0     |  <-- [Drawer "2" holds value 0]
         +------------+----------+
         |            |          |
         +-----------------------+


2. HOW THE DATA IS TAKEN OUT VISUALLY (THE READ STEP)
-----------------------------------------------------
When the loop moves to the number 7, the complement needed is 2. 
The line "[result[complement], i]" executes. Here is the visual pull:

STEP A: Look Up the Key
        The code requests: result[2]
        JavaScript runs straight to the cabinet and checks the labels.

STEP B: Extract the Value
        It finds the drawer labeled "2", pulls it open, and grabs the 
        data resting inside: 0.

                 Cabinet Lookup
               +---------------+
               |  "2" ───> [0]  |  <-- Value 0 is pulled out!
               +---------------+

STEP C: Package Into the Return Array Basket
        The engine takes that pulled value (0) and the current loop index
        value (i, which is 1), and drops them into the array bracket basket:

               [ result[2] ,  i ]
                   │          │
                   ▼          ▼
               [   0   ,  1 ]  ====> Final Array Output: [0, 1]


3. SUMMARY SUMMARY MENTAL IMAGE
-------------------------------
* STORING: Putting a piece of paper (Index) into a folder labeled with the Number.
* TAKING:  Using the Number to find the folder, pulling out the paper (Index), 
           and passing it to the console.
======================================================================

```







======================================================================
📝 STUDY NOTES: THE "TWO SUM" DICTIONARY PATTERN
======================================================================

1. THE CORE MECHANISM: READING VS. WRITING
------------------------------------------
The most critical distinction when handling dynamic dictionary memory is 
knowing whether you are extracting data or storing data.

* WRITING (Assignment) ➡️ Uses the `=` sign.
  Syntax: result[currentNum] = i;
  Action: Creates a brand-new slot in memory. It maps the array 
          number as the KEY and its position index as the VALUE.

* READING (Lookup) ➡️ No `=` sign.
  Syntax: [result[complement], i]
  Action: Reaches into the existing dictionary, looks up the 
          complement key, and pulls out its previously saved index 
          value to package it into a return array with the current index.


2. SCRIPT TRACE: STEP-BY-STEP MEMORY STATE
------------------------------------------
Input Array: [2, 7, 11, 15]  |  Target: 9

◆ Iteration 1 (i = 0)
  - currentNum = 2
  - complement = 9 - 2 = 7
  - Check: Is 7 in result? ❌ No, dictionary is empty {}.
  - Memory Operation: Save current number and index (WRITE).
    result[2] = 0; 
    -> Memory State: { "2": 0 }

◆ Iteration 2 (i = 1)
  - currentNum = 7
  - complement = 9 - 7 = 2
  - Check: Is 2 in result?  Yes! It matches our existing memory key.
  - Memory Operation: Retrieve old index and pair it with current index (READ).
    return [result[2], 1]; 
    -> Evaluates directly to: [0, 1]


3. THE FULL COMPLETED PRODUCTION CODE
-------------------------------------
function twosum(arr, target) {
    let result = {}; // Dictionary initialization (Wiped fresh per execution)

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        let currentNum = arr[i];
        let complement = target - currentNum;

        // STEP A: Look backward into memory (READ)
        if (complement in result) {
            return [result[complement], i]; // Returns: [stored_index, current_index]
        }

        // STEP B: Log forward into memory (WRITE)
        result[currentNum] = i; 
    }
}

// Execution test
let x = twosum([2, 7, 11, 15], 9);
console.log(x); // Output: [0, 1]
======================================================================

/*
result[currentNum] = i;
👉 Which means: result[2] = 0;

So right now, our dictionary looks like this under the hood:

JavaScript
let result = {
    2: 0   // Key is the number (2), Value is its index (0) - key value pair.
};
